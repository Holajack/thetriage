# Build Fix Summary - EAS Build Error Resolved

## Problem
Your EAS build was failing with the error:
```
Unable to resolve module ../../scripts/mock-admin-data from /Users/expo/workingdir/build/src/utils/userAppData.js
```

Additionally, there were non-fatal warnings about Three.js loader paths.

## Root Cause
1. **Main Issue**: The `src/utils/userAppData.js` file had an external require to `../../scripts/mock-admin-data` which doesn't exist in the built package. This was causing Metro bundler to fail during EAS cloud builds.

2. **Secondary Issue**: Three.js package exports configuration was pointing to files without extensions, causing warnings (though these were non-fatal as Metro falls back to file-based resolution).

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed userAppData.js ✅
- **Commit**: `192fb94` - "Fix: Remove external mock-admin-data import and use inline mock data helper"
- **Changes**:
  - Removed: `const mockDataHelper = require('../../scripts/mock-admin-data');`
  - Added: Inline `getLocalMockData()` function that provides mock data when needed
  - This eliminates the dependency on external script files that aren't included in the build

### 2. Optimized Metro Config ✅
- **Commit**: `cc45b1a` - "Improve Metro resolver config for Three.js loaders"
- **Changes**:
  - Added explicit source extensions configuration to help Metro resolve Three.js jsm files
  - This should reduce (though may not eliminate) the Three.js loader warnings

### 3. Cleared Build Caches ✅
- Removed `node_modules/.cache`
- Removed `ios/build` and `android/app/build` directories
- These ensure fresh builds pick up the changes

## Current Configuration

### Data Loading Strategy
Your app is configured to load **REAL Supabase data** by default:

```javascript
const USE_MOCK_DATA = false;      // ✅ Loads real data from Supabase
const USE_DEMO_MODE = false;       // ✅ Requires authentication
const FORCE_DEMO_ON_MOBILE = false; // ✅ Uses Supabase on mobile
```

### Fallback Behavior
The app includes comprehensive fallback handling:
- If authentication fails → Returns demo data
- If any Supabase query fails → Uses fallback values
- The inline `getLocalMockData()` function is only used when `USE_MOCK_DATA = true` (currently false)

## Next Steps

### 1. Rebuild Your App
Since the fixes have been committed and pushed to `main`, your next EAS build will include these changes:

```bash
# For iOS build
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# For Android build
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### 2. Verify the Build
The build should now complete successfully without the `mock-admin-data` error.

### 3. Test Data Loading
When the app runs:
- It will authenticate users via Supabase
- Fetch real user data from your Supabase tables
- Display actual session history, tasks, achievements, etc.
- Only fall back to demo data if authentication or queries fail

## Three.js Warnings (Optional)
The Three.js warnings about OBJLoader, GLTFLoader, MTLLoader, etc. are **non-fatal**. They occur because:
- Three.js package.json exports don't include `.js` extensions
- Metro bundler warns but successfully falls back to file-based resolution
- Your app's 3D brain visualization (OBJBrain3D component) still works correctly

If you want to eliminate these warnings completely, you could:
- Switch to a simpler 3D brain component (like SimpleBrain3D or LottieBrain3D)
- Or accept the warnings since they don't affect functionality

## Files Modified
1. `src/utils/userAppData.js` - Removed external mock-admin-data import
2. `metro.config.js` - Improved Three.js loader resolution

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Fixed userAppData.js to remove external dependency
- [x] Committed changes to git
- [x] Pushed changes to remote repository
- [x] Verified USE_MOCK_DATA = false (loads real data)
- [x] Optimized Metro config for Three.js
- [x] Cleared local build caches
- [ ] Next EAS build should succeed
- [ ] App should load real Supabase data in production

## Support
If the next build still fails, check:
1. EAS build logs for any new errors
2. Supabase configuration (ensure EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are set)
3. That your Supabase tables have proper RLS policies for authenticated users
