# Navigation Fix Complete ✅

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: RootNavigator was automatically routing authenticated users away from the Landing Page, preventing them from seeing their choice between "Get Started" and "Log In".

**Root Cause**: Lines 67-84 in RootNavigator.tsx contained automatic routing logic that redirected users from Landing Page to Main/Onboarding based on authentication status, violating the required flow.

## Solution Implemented

### Before Fix:
```tsx
// Case 2: User is already authenticated on app start (PWA users, returning users)
else if (currentRoute.name === 'Landing') {
  if (hasCompletedOnboarding) {
    // AUTOMATIC ROUTING - This was the problem!
    navigationRef.current.dispatch(
      CommonActions.reset({
        index: 0,
        routes: [{ name: 'Main' }],
      })
    );
  }
}
```

### After Fix:
```tsx
// Only handle navigation after successful login, not for existing authenticated users
if (isAuthenticated && currentRoute && currentRoute.name === 'Login') {
  // User just logged in from Login screen - route them appropriately
  if (hasCompletedOnboarding) {
    navigationRef.current.dispatch(
      CommonActions.reset({
        index: 0,
        routes: [{ name: 'Main' }],
      })
    );
  }
}
```

## Navigation Flow Now Working Correctly ✅

### Universal Flow (All Users):
```
App Start → Splash Screen → Landing Page
```

### From Landing Page:
- **"Get Started"** → Onboarding Flow → Home Screen
- **"Log In"** → Login Screen → (Post-login routing based on user state)

### Post-Login Routing:
- **Existing User** (has completed onboarding) → Home Screen
- **New User** (hasn't completed onboarding) → Onboarding Flow

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Automatic Routing**
- Eliminated the logic that automatically routed authenticated users from Landing Page
- Now only routes users after explicit authentication (successful login)

### 2. **Preserved Post-Login Navigation**
- Kept the logic that routes users appropriately after successful login
- Existing users still go directly to Main (HomeScreen)
- New users still go through Onboarding

### 3. **Maintained Logout Handling**
- Users are still properly returned to Landing Page when they log out

## Files Modified
- **`src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx`**: Removed automatic routing logic while preserving post-authentication routing

## Testing Status
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Navigation flow respects user choice
- ✅ Existing users can login and access app
- ✅ New users go through onboarding
- ✅ All users see Landing Page first

## Complete Task Status ✅

1. **✅ RLS Policy Fix**: Added comprehensive policies for leaderboard_stats table
2. **✅ Styling Consistency**: Updated all onboarding screens to match FocusMethodIntroScreen
3. **✅ Navigation Flow Fix**: Resolved automatic routing issue - users always see Landing Page first
4. **✅ Existing User Support**: Smart detection and automatic onboarding completion for existing users
5. **✅ Sign-in Navigation**: Fixed routing bug - users now properly navigate to HomeScreen after login

The navigation flow now works exactly as specified: **Splash Screen → Landing Page → (user choice: "Get Started" → Onboarding OR "Log In" → Login → appropriate destination)**.
