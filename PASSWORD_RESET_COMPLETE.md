## 🧪 What Needs Testing

### By User:

1. **Email Flow Test**
   - Request password reset
   - Check email inbox
   - Click reset link
   - Verify app opens

2. **Password Reset Test**
   - Enter new password
   - Verify validation works
   - Confirm password update succeeds
   - Test login with new password

3. **Edge Cases**
   - Try expired link (>1 hour old)
   - Try mismatched passwords
   - Try weak password
   - Test on both iOS and Android

### Supabase Configuration Required:

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Before testing, configure Supabase:

1. Go to: [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to: Authentication → URL Configuration
3. Add redirect URL: `hikewise://reset-password`
4. Save changes

Without this configuration, the deep link won't work!
