- ✅ Fallback data system implemented for missing tables
- ✅ Error handling implemented for graceful degradation

### 4. **App Development Server**
- ✅ Created and started Expo development server task
- ✅ App should be accessible at `http://localhost:8081` and `http://localhost:8083`
- ✅ All syntax errors resolved, app should bundle properly

## 🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### **Immediate Testing Steps**
1. **Check Development Server**
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:8081` or `http://localhost:8083`
   - Verify Expo dev tools are running
   - Look for QR code for mobile testing

2. **Mobile Testing**
   - Install Expo Go app on your phone
   - Scan the QR code shown in the browser/terminal
   - App should load with Triage System splash screen

3. **Screen Navigation Testing**
   - Test all main screens: Home, Analytics, Focus Session, Tasks, Leaderboard, Profile
   - Verify data is populated from Supabase (not mock data)
   - Check that demo user data appears in all screens

### **What Should Work**
- ✅ **Home Screen**: User profile, quick stats, inspiration quotes
- ✅ **Analytics Screen**: Study data charts and insights (now syntax error-free)
- ✅ **Focus Sessions**: Timer functionality with session tracking
- ✅ **Tasks Screen**: Task list and subtask management
- ✅ **Leaderboard**: Rankings and social features
- ✅ **Profile Screen**: User settings and preferences

### **Demo Mode Features**
- App runs without requiring authentication
- Uses demo user ID for all data fetching
- Provides realistic fallback data when tables are missing
- Graceful error handling for any missing functionality
